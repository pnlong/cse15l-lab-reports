## An Unexpected Party

> In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it a was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats- the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on – going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill – The Hill, as all the people for many miles around called it – and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the lefthand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.

This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was **Baggins**. The Bagginses have lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours’ respect, but he gainedwell, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.

It just so happens that *The Hobbit* (originally called *There and Back Again*) is one of my favorite books. Here are some of the reasons I like it so much:

1. It introduces Tolkien's *Lord of the Rings* legendarium.
2. It gives a look into the going-ons of dwarves, who receive little coverage later on in the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy.
3. Tolkien employs a very "flowy" (for lack of better term) voice in his writing that I enjoy reading.

**Fun Fact**: Tolkien introduced the word `dwarves` to the English language in *The Hobbit*. Previously, writers had spelled the word as `dwarfs`.
