# Lab Report 4

## *Vim*

This week, I learned all about the powerful command-line tool called **Vim**. In this lab, I clone a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7), find some bugs, make some edits, and commit my changes: *all from the command line*!

### Logging into `ieng6`

```
philliplong@Phillip-Longs-MacBook-Air ~ % ssh p1long@ieng6.ucsd.edu

Hello p1long, you are currently logged into ieng6-202.ucsd.edu

You are using 0% CPU on this system

To begin work for one of your courses [ cs15lwi24 ], type its name 
at the command prompt.  (For example, "cs15lwi24", without the quotes).

To see all available software packages, type "prep -l" at the command prompt,
or "prep -h" for more options.
[p1long@ieng6-202]:~:128$ cs15lwi24
Wed Feb 21, 2024 11:17am - Prepping cs15lwi24
```

**Keys Pressed**: `ssh p1long@ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter>cs15lwi24<enter>`

My first step was to `ssh` onto `ieng6`. Because I had previously set up an `ssh` key, I was not prompted for a password, greatly expediting this process. I then entered `cs15lwi24`, which is a shortcut that changes my current working directory such that my new directory is course-specific to CSE15L (`/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi24/p1long`).

### Clone the Forked Repository

```
[p1long@ieng6-202]:p1long:129$ git clone git@github.com:pnlong/lab7.git

[p1long@ieng6-202]:p1long:130$ cd lab7
```

**Keys Pressed**: `git clone <command><v><enter>cd l<tab><enter>`

For some background, before the lab, I set up an `ssh` key on `ieng6` to connect with GitHub, which allows me to clone repositories with an `ssh`, as opposed to `https`, address. I also forked the [lab7 GitHub repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7), and my fork can be found [here](https://github.com/pnlong/lab7). Back to the present, I copied the `ssh` URL from my lab7 fork. I proceeded to enter `git clone `, and then pasted the `ssh` URL with the âŒ˜V shortcut. I then changed my working directory to the cloned repository `lab7` with `cd`, employing tab autocomplete to avoid typing out the full directory name.

### Run the Failing Tests

```
[p1long@ieng6-202]:lab7:131$ sh test.sh
JUnit version 4.13.2
..E
Time: 0.518
There was 1 failure:
1) testMerge2(ListExamplesTests)
org.junit.runners.model.TestTimedOutException: test timed out after 500 milliseconds
	at ListExamples.merge(ListExamples.java:44)
	at ListExamplesTests.testMerge2(ListExamplesTests.java:19)

FAILURES!!!
Tests run: 2,  Failures: 1
```

**Keys Pressed**: `sh t<tab><enter>`

My next step was to run the tester shell script. Already knowing the file structure of `lab7`, I simply entered `sh t` and then employed tab autocomplete to complete the filename, as I knew that `test.sh` was the only file that started with a `t`. Running this script showed me that out of my two tests, one of them was failing. I needed to get to work!

### Edit the Code, Make Bug Fixes

```
[p1long@ieng6-202]:lab7:132$ vim ListExamples.java
```
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

interface StringChecker { boolean checkString(String s); }

class ListExamples {

  // Returns a new list that has all the elements of the input list for which
  // the StringChecker returns true, and not the elements that return false, in
  // the same order they appeared in the input list;
  static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for(String s: list) {
      if(sc.checkString(s)) {
        result.add(0, s);
      }
    }
    return result;
  }


  // Takes two sorted list of strings (so "a" appears before "b" and so on),
  // and return a new list that has all the strings in both list in sorted order.
  static List<String> merge(List<String> list1, List<String> list2) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int index1 = 0, index2 = 0;
    while(index1 < list1.size() && index2 < list2.size()) {
      if(list1.get(index1).compareTo(list2.get(index2)) < 0) {
        result.add(list1.get(index1));
        index1 += 1;
      }
      else {
        result.add(list2.get(index2));
        index2 += 1;
      }
    }
    while(index1 < list1.size()) {
      result.add(list1.get(index1));
      index1 += 1;
    }
    while(index2 < list2.size()) {
      result.add(list2.get(index2));
      // change index1 below to index2 to fix test
      index2 += 1;
    }
    return result;
  }


}

**Keys Pressed**: `vim L<tab>.j<tab><enter>43jer2:wq<enter>`

To make edits to the repository's code base, I would need a command-line text editor: *Vim*! I entered `vim L` then used tab autocomplete to avoid typing out `ListExamples`. However, because there are multiple files in `lab7` that start with the pattern `ListExamples`, I needed to type `.j` to avoid matching both the `ListExamplesTests` files and `ListExamples.class`, which was created previously by running the `test.sh` script. I then used tab autocomplete to avoid typing out the `.java` file type. I had now entered the *Vim* interface. Breaking down the *Vim* command, I jumped down to the 44th line (the line with the error) with `43j` and then jumped to the end of the first word of that line (`index1`) with `e`. This moved my cursor to the `1` character, which happened to be the exact character I needed to fix, so I then entered `r2` to replace the `1` with a `2`, fixing the bug. To save my work and exit *Vim*, I entered `:wq`, where `w` writes the file and `q` quits *Vim*.

### Rerun the Tests

```
[p1long@ieng6-202]:lab7:133$ sh test.sh 
JUnit version 4.13.2
..
Time: 0.015

OK (2 tests)

```

**Keys Pressed**: `<up><up><enter>`

Back in the normal terminal, I now wanted to rerun `test.sh`. Because I knew that I had already done this before, I simply went back two commands in my Bash history by pressing the up-arrow twice. Back at the command `sh test.sh`, I reran my tests.

### Commit and Push Changes to GitHub

```
[p1long@ieng6-202]:lab7:134$ git commit -a -m "bug fixes"
[main c05c3c9] bug fixes
 Committer: Phillip Long <p1long@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu>

```

**Keys Pressed**: `git commit -a -m "bug fixes"<enter>git push origin main<enter>`

To commit my changes, I fully-typed out `git commit -a -m "bug fixes"`, as I do not know any shortcuts to expedite this command. The `-a` option stages every altered file in the repository to be committed, and the `-m` option allows me to specify my commit message. With my changes committed, I then pushed them with `git push origin main`; again, I do not know any keyboard shortcuts to expedite this command, so I typed it out in its entirety.

Just like that, I had fixed my bugs. Thank you for reading my lab report. One more left!
